# This file defines how hardware connects to the network
# Models here must be represented cray-network-hardware.yaml
# Definition of network components: model, size, speeds, etc...
# NOTE:  Only specify upward/north connections and east/west (MLAG).
#        1. compute/ncn specify connections to leafs
#        2. leafs specify connections to spines
#        3. spines specify connections to superspines
# network_v2 is full systems with agg/leaf switches
# network_v2_tds is where NCNs plug directly into the spines
# network_v1 is Dell/Mellanox

# architecture_type: lookup_mapper[*]lookup_name.architecture_type should match components[*]name.model
